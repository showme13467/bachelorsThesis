%YOUR Report
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%In case you like to write in German start without any changes in the following
%       -  For the German special characters use the following format: 
%          √Ñ =  {\"A}, O = {\"O}, √ú = {\"U}, a = {\"a}, √∂ = {\"o},  √º = {\"u}, and √ü = {\ss}
%In case you like to write in English 
%       - comment out lines 178 and 179
%       - and delete the comment sign "%" in lines 180 and 181
%
%To compile your report compile the file report.tex in the general folder!
%
%Some further regulations for writing the report:
%	  - The abstract should be minimum 1/4 page long.
%       - The Introduction section NEEDS to end with a subsection giving information 
%          about what the reader will expect to read in the rest of the report.
%.      - No subfolders for figures are allowed. Put the direct in the folder Talk1
%.      - To get code examples for Latex feel free to consult the Talk0 source code 
%         for that or google. 
%       - Use label ("\label") in order to make references dynamic. This should be 
%         done for sections, figures, tables, and listings.
%       - In case you refer to a section followed by the corresponding number 
%         directly behind you write it in the following manner: Section 1.1. 
%         Same holds for figures, tables and listings
%.      - Each figure, table and listing must be cross-referred in text and the main 
%         message needs to be mentioned.
%.      - The caption of figure, table and listing is NOT allowed to be longer than 1 line.
%       - For algorithms use the package listing and NOT another one.
%       - References HAVE to be done in a .bib file called literaturtalk1.bib that is already 
%         in your talk folder.
%       - DO NOT use
%              - any additional packages at all.
%			 - For Algorithms use the package "listing".
%              	- For mathematic expressions use the package "amsmath", supporting 
%.                       also the classic math-mode in Latex.
%              - any appendix in your report at all.
%       	- floating text around figures at all. 
%              - the construct "minipages".
%.      	- " \\" at the end of paragraphs. a spaceline does the same. 
%                Just use " \\" if you like to have no spaceline, meaning the content of two 
%                paragraphs belongs context-wise together. 
%
%Remarks/Experiences: 
%.      - In case you use online tools for compiling Latex trouble can occur. This is 
%         known for Overleaf. 
%.      - In case you do not have installed Latex tools on your system you can use 
%         citrix and login in to the Servers of RZ. The machine powered there has 
%         Latex installed and also has a link to you host system's memory.
